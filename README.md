# Get Hands-On with AI Apps â€“ An App Innovation Bootcamp

This initiative is not merely about enhancing skills; it is about spearheading the future of innovation. We are commencing this journey with a special bootcamp designed to elevate foundational AI skills. This bootcamp will offer a dynamic, hands-on experience, allowing your team to immerse themselves in AI technologies that will drive the next wave of application innovation.

## Getting Started

This LevelUP will be a guided session with 8 lessons and laboratories.

We have created a **[Course Setup](./00-course-setup/README.md)** section to help you with setting up your development environment.

## Reference

The material for this LevelUP session is derived from the [Generative AI for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners) repository. This session is designed to provide a foundational understanding of Large Language Models and their practical applications. Upon completion, participants are encouraged to explore the repository at their own pace to gain a more comprehensive understanding.
